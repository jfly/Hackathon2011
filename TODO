-deterministic ordering of channel members? age or nick?
	-need to add age attribute to members
		-use age to assign admin status
-add a ready, set, go?
	-show timer
-add chat support
	+gray out our messages until we know they hit the server
	+reorder messages on client side if necessary
	+store last 100 messages on the server and feed them to the client upon connect
	-add timestamps, maybe gchat style
	-should the chat bar be resizeable? how about pop out-able?
