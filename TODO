**** Client side ****
+deterministic ordering of channel members? age or nick?
	+sizing of boards
		+visually indicate self, and always place it on top?
+add control messages to chat
	+joined channel
	+user joined/parted/admined
	-stop sending clientId_user list when it isn't necessary!
+add chat support
	+gray out our messages until we know they hit the server
	+reorder messages on client side if necessary
	+store last 100 messages on the server and feed them to the client upon connect
	+add gchat style timestamps
	+resizing smaller is losing fully scrolledness
	+focus indicator for chat bar
+BUG: on startup one of the state bars doesn't go away
+make chat area hideable
	+clicking on the chat area should focus the chat bar
	+pressing tab unconditionally focuses the chat area
	+pressing twiddle ~ (or tab?) when chat bar is minimized
		+esc minimizes chat bar?
	+pgup, pgdown while focused on chatbox
+BUG: "sent at" message doesn't scroll?
+misc chat improvments
	+consecutive chats from the same person shouldn't cause a new "Nick:" prefix
	+add some spacing between chat messages
	+"me: " instead of "Nick: " for your own chats
+add a ready, set, go?
	+show timer on each board

-save game configuration
	-cookies for now, accounts later?
-better mechanics for minimizing in Split.js
	-why can't you drag when minimized?
-make info div pretty
	-if the user types in empty nick or channelname, nothing happens

**** Server side ****
-if the sole member of a channel hits refresh, we immediately nuck the channel, maybe we could set off a timer to do so instead?
