**** Client side ****
+deterministic ordering of channel members? age or nick?
	+sizing of boards
		+visually indicate self, and always place it on top?
+add control messages to chat
	+joined channel
	+user joined/parted/admined
	-stop sending clientId_user list when it isn't necessary!
+add chat support
	+gray out our messages until we know they hit the server
	+reorder messages on client side if necessary
	+store last 100 messages on the server and feed them to the client upon connect
	+add gchat style timestamps
	+resizing smaller is losing fully scrolledness
	+focus indicator for chat bar
+BUG: on startup one of the state bars doesn't go away
+make chat area hideable
	+clicking on the chat area should focus the chat bar
	+pressing tab unconditionally focuses the chat area
	+pressing twiddle ~ (or tab?) when chat bar is minimized
		+esc minimizes chat bar?
	+pgup, pgdown while focused on chatbox
+BUG: "sent at" message doesn't scroll?
+misc chat improvments
	+consecutive chats from the same person shouldn't cause a new "Nick:" prefix
	+add some spacing between chat messages
	+"me: " instead of "Nick: " for your own chats
+add a ready, set, go?
	+show timer on each board
+fix innacurrate timing bug
+change protocol to send human readable turns rather than json

-save game configuration
	-cookies for now, accounts later?
-better mechanics for minimizing in Split.js
	-why can't you drag when minimized?
-make info div pretty
	-if the user types in empty nick or channelname, nothing happens

-editing name while server info gets set is really annoying

-RAs and shit, graphs!
-strip HTML tags from chats

**** Server side ****

-analytics! STORE EVERYTHING!
	-smarter server, keep track of what is going on, send all state to clients
		-besides simplifying some stuff, this also solves the problem where the game "changes" (users joining while solving gets screwy)
		 while inspecting (because the admin sends out gratuitous gameinfos when people connect)
