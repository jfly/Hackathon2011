-add a ready, set, go?
	-show timer
		-put timer & inspection inside of the infodiv?
-save game configuration
	-cookies for now, accounts later?

-better mechanics for minimizing in Split.js
	-why can't you drag when minimized?

-make infodiv & chat area hideable
	+clicking on the chat area should focus the chat bar
	+pressing tab unconditionally focuses the chat area
	+pressing twiddle ~ (or tab?) when chat bar is minimized
		+esc minimizes chat bar?
	+pgup, pgdown while focused on chatbox
	-make info div pretty, size the area correctly
-if the user types in empty nick or channelname, nothing happens

**** Server side ****
-if the sole member of a channel hits refresh, we immediately nuck the channel, maybe we could set off a timer to do so instead?
