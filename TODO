**** Client side ****
-gracefully handle node restarting/losing connection
	-now.js's client side library seems to handle this by eventually recalling now.ready()
-deterministic ordering of channel members? age or nick?
	-need to add age attribute to members
		-use age to assign admin status
-add a ready, set, go?
	-show timer
-deal with people joining in the middle of a solve
-improve behavior of Status bar (see comments in StatusBar.js)

**** Server side ****
